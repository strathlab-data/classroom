# Strath Lab Classroom

_A collaborative environment for innovative models, coding techniques, and research methodologies_

## Overview

Welcome to the **Open Source Research Collaboration Hub**. This repository is designed as a dynamic and experimental space for developing, testing, and refining cutting-edge models and coding practices that advance our understanding in key research areas. Here, students, researchers, and collaborators from the University of Florida and partner institutions are invited to contribute, learn, and innovate together.

This hub will feature a substantial amount of **Python** and **R** code, making it an ideal environment for exploring data analysis, statistical modeling, and computational experiments.

## About the Lab & Principal Investigator

This repository is part of a research lab led by **Assistant Professor Larissa J. Strath** at the University of Florida. Her research primarily focuses on the effects that dietary composition has on the modulation of the pain experience through epigenetic and immune mechanisms. She investigates how nutrition influences the development, persistence, and severity of various painful conditions—such as chronic low back pain, knee osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia—by examining factors like inflammation, oxidative stress, and the interplay with cognitive functions. Her work spans basic science, clinical research, and epidemiological studies, with special emphasis on sex, gender, and racial disparities.

## Purpose of the Repository

This repository is built to be an **open source environment** where you can:

- **Experiment:** Test out new computational models and data analysis techniques using languages like Python and R.
- **Collaborate:** Work alongside fellow students, data analysts, and researchers from multiple institutions.
- **Learn:** Explore innovative coding practices and emerging research methodologies.
- **Contribute:** Share your insights and code with a community dedicated to advancing research in nutritional biochemistry, neuroscience, pain medicine, and more.

Our aim is to build a community that not only explores state-of-the-art techniques but also integrates interdisciplinary approaches to solve real-world research problems.
